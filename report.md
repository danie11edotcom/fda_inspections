#Food and Drug Administration Inspections Report

##Analysis Process
1. Step 1: download inspection data
2. Step 2: remove years with partial inspection results (2008 and 2015)
3. Step 3: select first center and summarize results by year, project area and district
4. Step 4. export summaries to excel (not csv so that I can add multiple sheets to one workbook with excel writer)
5. Step 5. plot with Excel (most familiar with Excel to get plots the way I want them to look; will have to learn matplotlib and d3.js more to do plots as book and better for the same application in same amount of time or less) and save plots as images (add danie11e.com to image to copyright)
